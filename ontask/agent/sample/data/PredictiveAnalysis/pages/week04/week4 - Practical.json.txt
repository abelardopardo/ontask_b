<h3>Practical</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>In this Practical we will learn how to build and interpret a decision tree in R. However, before fitting a predictive model, we will also go through some of the steps we covered in Practicals 2 and 3.</p>
<p>There are several packages in R that can be used to fit a decision tree. We will be working with rpart, as it allows us high flexibility and is rather easy to use.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Load and explore data.</li>
    <li>Build a decision tree.</li>
    <li>Create a fully grown tree.</li>
    <li>Prune the decision tree.</li>
    <li><span>Make a prediction using the model we built.</span></li>
</ul>
