<h4 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1691842771139_130">Week 7 Lecture - Rule-Based classifiers</h4>
<p dir="ltr">We are moving from decision trees and this week we are starting to discuss other classification methods. As I mentioned in the lecture, each of the topics we will be covering in the next several weeks can be (and usually is) a course on its own. Please make sure you go through all the materials (lectures, readings and practicals) and feel free to reach out if anything remains unclear.</p>
