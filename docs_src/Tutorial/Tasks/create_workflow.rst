After creating the workflow, the next screen has the menu to upload data to the table. The current workflow is shown underneath the top menu as shown in the following figure (the string *BIOL1011* with a blue background).

You can always click in the *Workflows* item at the top menu to go back to the home page and select a different workflow to open (or create a new one).

From the home page you can also perform some additional operations in the workflow such as:

  - rename and change the workflow description,
  - cloning (create and exact replica of this workflow with another name),
  - delete all data in the workflow table, or
  - delete the workflow.

From any screen in the platform, the icon in the top right corner next to your profile image is a link to the OnTask documentation.
