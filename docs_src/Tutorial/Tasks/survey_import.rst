***************************

OnTask offers a `library of pre-defined surveys <https://github.com/abelardopardo/ontask_b/tree/master/surveys>`__ that can be uploaded directly into one of your existing workflows. Go to the |fa-comments| *Action* page of an existing workflow (or alternatively create a workflow and upload some data). Download one of the `pre-defined tests <https://github.com/abelardopardo/ontask_b/tree/master/surveys>`__ and store the file in your computer.

Click in the *import action* button.
