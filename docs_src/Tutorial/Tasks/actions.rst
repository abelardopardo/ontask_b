OnTask contains functions to manage three type of actions:

Personalized text
  These actions allow to create a HTML text in which some of its elements may be present/ignored depending on the how a condition is evaluated for every student.

Surveys
  A set of questions for the students to answer. The information is collected and automatically added to the table in the workflow.

Personalized JSON object
  These actions allow to create a `JSON object <https://json.org>`_ with elements in its structure that can be present or ignored depending on how a condition is evaluated for every student (similarly to the previous actions)
