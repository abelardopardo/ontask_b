Table Views
===========

For tables with a large number of columns and/or rows OnTask allows you to define a *view* of the table that shows only a subset of it. To create a view click first in the *Views* button at the top of the table page and then the *Add View* in the next page. Insert a name, description and select some of the columns as shown in the following figure.

   :width: 60%

You can also define views to show only a subset of rows. The subset is selected using a *row filter* stating the conditions that must be satisfied by a row to be included in the view. These conditions are stated in terms of the column values.

Save the view and then click on the *View* button. The appropriate table subset is shown. The buttons at the top of the page allow you to edit the view (change the rows and columns selected), or select another available view.

Column and Row Statistics
=========================

If you click on one of the |fa-chart-bar| *Statistics* icons in the left-most column of a row OnTask shows a page with statistical representation of the population values for the columns and a mark denoting where is the value of the selected row.
