Making content available through OnTask
***************************************

An alternative to send an email is to make the personalized text available
through a URL that is provided by OnTask. This URL can be enabled by clicking
in the *URL* button of the action operations.

If learners are allowed to connect to OnTask (they have an account), their
email is part of the data stored in the workflow,  and the access to the
platform can be done through a Single Sign-on system (e.g. LTI through a
learning management system), the URL shown in the  previous figure will allow
them to access the personalized text.
