The Top Menu
************

OnTask assumes that you will be working with one workflow. The first screen (the one that appears when you log in or when you click on the *Workflows* link in the top menu) shows you the workflows available. To start working with one of them you have to *Open* it. Once you open a workflow, the top menu appears as shown in the following figure.

.. sidebar:: Superuser

   If your account has *superuser* or *admin* privileges, the top menu will include the additional option with name |fa-cog| *Admin*. This menu provides access to the  pages to manage administration tasks, the connections to SQL relational databases, and the set of installed plugins. These connections are available to instructors as part of the operations to Upload/Merge data into the table.
