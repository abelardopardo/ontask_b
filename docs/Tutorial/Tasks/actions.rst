OnTask contains functions to manage the following types of actions:

Personalized text
  These actions allow to create a HTML text in which some of its elements may be present/ignored depending on the how a condition is evaluated for every student.

Personalized rubric
  These actions allow to create a HTML text in which a rubric is used to provide learners with feedback about their level of attainment.

Surveys
  A set of questions for the students to answer. The information is collected and automatically added to the table in the workflow.

Personalized JSON object
  These actions allow to create a `JSON object <https://json.org>`_ with elements in its structure that can be present or ignored depending on how a condition is evaluated for every student (similarly to the previous actions)

Personalized Canvas Email
  Similar to the HTML text but using plain text and the messages are sent using the mail functionality of the Canvas Learning Management System.
