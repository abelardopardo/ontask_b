The buttons at the top of the page offer the following functions:

|fa-plus| Row
  A form to introduce a new row in the table with one field per column.

|fa-plus| Column
  Add a new column to the table. The pull-down menu also allows to add a column with values calculated with a formula and using the existing values, or a column with random values.

|fa-eye| Views
  A view is a screen showing a subset of rows and/or columns in the table. Clicking in the Views link will take you to another screen to manage these views. The pull down menu offers links to access the subset of the table defined by the available views.

|fa-dashboard| Dashboard
  The dashboard shows a statistical summary for the columns shown in the table. This number may be too high, so you should consider using table views to reduce the amount of information shown in the dashboard.

|fa-bar-chart| Column statistics
  This button allows to choose a non-key column and show an statistic summary of its values

|fa-download| CSV Download
  This functionality downloads the data in the table as a CSV file. Combine this functionality with the table views to handle large tables.
