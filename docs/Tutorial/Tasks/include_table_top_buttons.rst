|bi-plus| Row
  A form to introduce a new row in the table with one field per column.

|bi-plus| Column
  Add a new column to the table. The pull-down menu also allows to add a column with values calculated with a formula and using the existing values, or a column with random values.

|bi-eye-fill| Views
  A view is a screen showing a subset of rows and/or columns in the table. Clicking in the **Views** shows options to create a new view, show the data in a view, or go back to the full table view.

|bi-graph-up-arrow| Dashboard
  The dashboard shows a statistical summary for the columns shown in the table. This number may be too high, so you should consider using table views to reduce the amount of information shown in the dashboard.

|bi-bar-chart-line-fill| Column statistics
  This button allows to choose a non-key column and show an statistic summary of its values

|bi-download| CSV Download
  This functionality downloads the data in the table as a CSV file. Combine this functionality with the table views to handle large tables.

|bi-plus| Action with filter
  Create an action using the restriction in the number of rows as the filter. This option is only available if the view has defined a filter condition.
