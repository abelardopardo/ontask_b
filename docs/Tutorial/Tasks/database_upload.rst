OnTask allows to upload or merge data into a workflow's table using a
previously configured connection clicking in the button |bi-plus| *SQL Connection*.

This link will be active only if these connections have been previously
configured by the system administrator. After selecting the option to upload
from a database, the next page shows either a form to select one of the
available SQL connections, or if there is a single one, a message confirming
its use.

After selecting a connection, the rest of the steps are identical to those used
to either :ref:`upload new data<data_upload>` or :ref:`merge data with the existing table <merging>`.
