The Administration Pages
************************

OnTask uses the administration pages offered by Django. The account created with
the command ``createsuperuser`` has complete access to those pages through a
link in the upper right corner of the screen.

These pages offer access to several important operations:

- The elements of each of the models stored in the database (workflows,
  actions, conditions, columns, etc). Each model has its corresponding page
  allowing the creation, update and deletion of any object.

- The user information. This is a special model representing the users, their
  name, credentials, etc. The platform allows the creation of user accounts.

- The group information. The platform differentiates users based on groups.
  Each group has different functionalities.

Once the instance is running, visit these pages and configure the platform to
your needs.
