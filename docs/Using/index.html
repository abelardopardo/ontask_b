<p>In a nutshell, the idea of OnTask is to help instructors, learners and designers to exchange data  about what is happening in a learning experience to design and deploy personalized learner support actions. This last term, <em>personalized support actions</em> is purposefully vague to include any action that is offered to learners in different forms depending on personalized conditions. The typical <em>workflow</em> to use OnTask starts by uploading and combining available data about the learning experience, either provided through some platform (LMS, video platform), provided by the students (questionnaires), or reported by the instructors. The instructors then write simple rules to select a subset of students and create a resource (HTML page, a message, a visualization) so that its content depends on the data available for each learner. The following figure shows an illustration of this workflow:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/ontask_workflow.png"><img alt="../_images/ontask_workflow.png" src="../_images/ontask_workflow.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Imagine a learning experience in which you want to provide personalized messages to the learners in three instances. In the first week, you want to send a welcome email and change slightly the text based on the student background (courses taken before this one). The second week you want to send some comments and suggestions about the participation in the forum and the text will depend on the measures of engagement obtained from the platform. Finally, you want to send a third personalized email depending on the level of engagement with the videos in the course. The idea of these messages is that you want to change the text in the message for each learner based on the information stored in the table.</p>
<p>The main entity in the platform is a <a class="reference internal" href="#workflow"><span class="std std-ref">*workflow*</span></a> and represents a set of data capturing procedures, a table with current data, and a set of actions. The usual steps require first to populate the table with data extracted from the learning environment. In the figure we assume a variety of data sources ranging from those coming from the use of technology, self-reported by the students, or observed and reported by the instructors.</p>
<p>These three sources are combined and stored in the second entity in OnTask: the table. Think of the table as a conventional excel sheet storing the information about the learners (one learner per row and a set of features about each learner as columns).</p>
<p>The third entity in OnTask is the <em>personalized action</em> that is a text with elements that are selected and adapted to each learner based on a set of basic rules that depend on the student features stored in the table. This text can be included in an email, made available through a web page, or forwarded to another system for further processing.</p>
<p>A workflow in OnTask contains a single table (rows and columns) and a set of
actions. This container is conceived to manage the data and actions related
to a learning experience. You may use the workflow shown in the documentation
importing  the <a class="reference download internal" download="" href="../_downloads/3f296252720ca5cd234946310996f00b/initial_workflow.gz"><code class="xref download docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">initial</span> <span class="pre">workflow</span></code></a>.</p>
<p>The following sections offer a more in-depth description of all these elements as well as examples with real scenarios.</p>

<p>The workflow in OnTask is simply a container that brings together the table,
the operations to upload the data, and the actions to create the
personalized content. The initial screen in OnTask shows the available
workflows as shown in the following figure.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-columns">
<span id="columns"></span><h3>The Columns<a class="headerlink" href="#the-columns" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The data in a workflow is stored in a structure called <em>a table</em> that is made
of rows and columns (similar to a spreadsheet). The details page
basically shows information about the available columns.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/wokflow_columns.png" src="../_images/wokflow_columns.png" />
</div>
<p>Each column has a position, name (cannot contain the quotes <em>‘</em> or <em>“</em>), a type
(one of integer, string, double, boolean or date/time), a field stating if the
values of that column are unique for the rows, and operations. When a column is
marked as <em>Unique</em>, it means that all the values it contains are different and
unique for each row. Think of a column containing a passport number. Such
number is different for every person. There could be several columns with this
property. The application detects automatically this property in a column. You
may edit and change this properly as long as the values are the adequate ones
(they satisfy the uniqueness property if you try mark a column as unique). The
operations available over columns are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Edit</dt>
<dd><p class="first">It allows you to change the name, type, unique and values allowed in the
column. If you are changing the column type, the application will check if
the existing values are valid. If not, the change will not be allowed.
Similarly, if the <em>Unique</em> property is selected, the application checks the
values to make sure this property is satisfied.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/workflow_column_edit.png" src="../_images/workflow_column_edit.png" />
</div>
<p class="last">The column may also have a <em>validity window</em> defined by two date/times.
This validity is used when executing <em>action in</em> tasks.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Restrict</dt>
<dd>Assigns as <em>allowed values</em> for the column those currently stored. This
operation is useful to transform a generic column into one with values
limited to the current ones.</dd>
<dt>Clone</dt>
<dd>Clones the column in the workflow changing its name adding the prefix <em>Copy
of</em> to the name.</dd>
<dt>Delete</dt>
<dd>Deletes the column from the workflow. If there are conditions inside
<em>actions out</em> that use this column, those conditions will be removed from
the action.</dd>
<dt>Statistics</dt>
<dd>Shows a statistical summary of the values in the column. If the data type

<blockquote>
<div>“May be stories are are just data without a soul”
– Brené Brown</div></blockquote>
<p>This section describes the operations to upload and merge data into the table.
It may be the case that this task is already done, or it is done
automatically before you work with a workflow. If this is the case, you may
skip this section. The data operations page offers various options to upload
and merge data to the table and the process is divided into several steps.
This functionality is available from the <em>Details</em>, <em>Table</em> or <em>Actions</em>
screens.</p>
<div class="section" id="upload-merge-data">
<h3>Upload/Merge Data<a class="headerlink" href="#upload-merge-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This functionality is used to upload new data in to the table, or merge new
data with the one already existing in the table. There are three types of
operations depending if the data is obtained form a CSV file, an Excel file,
or a connection to a remote database.</p>
<div class="section" id="upload-csv-files">
<h4>Upload CSV Files<a class="headerlink" href="#upload-csv-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>CSV or “comma separated value” files are plain text files in which the first line contains a comma-separated list of column names, and every subsequent line contains the values of these columns for each row. It is a popular format to exchange data that can be represented as a table, and it is for this reason that OnTask allows to upload data in this format.</p>
<p>This operation allows you to upload the values in a CSV file into the
workflow table.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_csvupload1.png" src="../_images/dataops_csvupload1.png" />
</div>
<p>In some cases, the comma-separated values are surrounded by several lines
that need to be ignored when processing the data. The page to upload the
CSV file allows you to specify the number of lines to ignore at the start
and end of the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upload-excel-files">
<h4>Upload Excel Files<a class="headerlink" href="#upload-excel-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>OnTask also supports the upload of data from Excel files.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_upload_excel.png" src="../_images/dataops_upload_excel.png" />
</div>
<p>In this case the file is assumed to have multiple <em>Sheets</em> and one of them
has to be selected to upload the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sql-connection">
<span id="sql-connection-run"></span><h4>SQL connection<a class="headerlink" href="#sql-connection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The third method to upload data into the current workflow is through a SQL
connection to a remote database. These connections have to be
<a class="reference internal" href="../Install/index.html#sql-connections"><span class="std std-ref">previously defined and configured by the system administrator</span></a>. Instructors can use them to access the content of a
previously defined table in a remote database. The option to upload data with
a SQL connection shows the available connections and the possibility to
<em>Run</em> each one of them:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_SQL_available.png" src="../_images/dataops_SQL_available.png" />
</div>
<p>When <em>running</em> a SQL connection the platform shows the configuration
parameters and requests the password to access the remote database (if
required).</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_SQL_run.png" src="../_images/dataops_SQL_run.png" />
</div>
<p>When uploading data for the first time, the values are prepared to be assigned
as the initial content of the table. Before this assignment is done,
the platform first automatically detects those columns that have unique
values (no repetitions) and marks them as <em>keys</em>. Key columns are very
important because the values (as they are different for
every row) are used for various operation. There must be <strong>at least one key
column</strong> in the workflow and it is possible to remove the <em>key</em> mark from any
column and only possible to mark a column as key if the values are all
different. Before assigning the data to the table, the platform also allows
to change the name of the columns as shown in the Step 2 of the upload process.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_upload_merge_step2.png" src="../_images/dataops_upload_merge_step2.png" />
</div>
<p>After this step (if the table is empty), the data is stored and
the platform shows the <a class="reference internal" href="#details"><span class="std std-ref">Workflow Details</span></a> page. If the upload operation is executed
with a workflow with existing data in the table, then instead of an
upload, the platform executes a <strong>merge</strong> operation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-merge">
<h2>Data Merge<a class="headerlink" href="#data-merge" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Merge a.k.a “Join”</p>
<p class="last">Merging is a common operation in databases and is commonly known as <em>join</em>.
There are several variants of join operations depending how the
differences between the key columns are handled. These same variants exist
when combining columns in data frames (or a table).</p>
</div>
<p>A merge operation is required when uploading a set of columns with an
<strong>already existing table</strong>. This operation is very common in data science
contexts. One of the problems is to specify how the values in the columns are
<em>matched</em> with respect to the ones already existing in the table. In other
words, each new column has a set of values, but they need to be in the right
order so that the information is matched appropriately for every row. The
solution for this problem is to include in both the existing table and the
new data being merged a <strong>unique or key column</strong>. These columns have the
property that uniquely distinguish each row with a value and therefore they are
used to make sure that rows with matching values in these columns are merged.
When uploading data into a workflow that already contains data in its
table, the platform automatically executes additional steps to complete a <em>merge</em> operation.</p>

<p>In any of these variants, for those columns that are present in both the existing table and the new table, the values of the second will update the existing ones. This updating operation may introduce non-values in some of the columns. You have to take extra care when performing this operation as it may destroy part of the existing data. In the extreme case, if you try to merge a table with a key column with no values in common with the existing key and you select the method that considers rows with keys in both the existing and new table, the result is an empty table.</p>
<p>After selecting these parameters the last step is to review the effect of the operation and proceed with the merge as shown in the following figure.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>“In order to carry a positive action we must develop here a positive
vision”
– Dalai Lama</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the most important functionality of the platform. Actions are
used exchange information with the learners, either offering a personalized
document, or requesting data. A workflow contains an arbitrary number of
actions shown in the <em>Table</em> page.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/actions.png"><img alt="../_images/actions.png" src="../_images/actions.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Each action is identified by a name (unique) and an optional description.
OnTask currently offers the following types of actions: personalized text,
personalized JSON, and surveys. The action table shows also the operations
available for each of them (right most column in the table shown in the
previous figure).</p>
<div class="section" id="personalized-content">
<h3>Personalized Content<a class="headerlink" href="#personalized-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These actions allow to create a resource (similar to a HTML page) and mark
certain elements with <em>conditions</em> that will control if they are included or
ignored when showing the document. Think of this personalized content as a
resource (message, tip, comment) you would offer learners but with content
that is different depending on the data stored in the table. You may have
several of these items prepared to be used at different points during the
experience. The personalized content action is manipulated with the screen
shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_edit_action_out.png"><img alt="../_images/action_edit_action_out.png" src="../_images/action_edit_action_out.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Before describing in detail the structure of this screen let’s explore the
concept of <em>condition</em>. A condition is an
expression that when evaluated will either be <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.
These expressions are commonly used in other applications such as
spreadsheets or programming languages. The following image shows an example
of this condition.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/action_action_out_edit_filter.png" src="../_images/action_action_out_edit_filter.png" />
</div>
<p>The expression in the previous figure is contained under the title
<strong>Formula</strong> and can be read as:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Video_1_W4 = 0 or Video_2_W4 = 0</div></blockquote>
<p>The first element of the expression is the sub-expression <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code>
which contains the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span></code>, the equal sign, and the constant
zero. The second element is a sub-expression with the variable
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_2_W4</span></code>, the equal sign, and the constant 0. These two
sub-expresssions are connected through the <strong>OR</strong> operator, which means
that the expression will be <strong>True</strong> if either of the sub-expressions are
<strong>True</strong>, and <strong>False</strong> in any other case. When evaluating this expression,
the variables are replaced by concrete values (numbers). For example, if
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span></code> is replaced by 3, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_2_W4</span></code> is replaced by 4, the
evaluation will transform the expression into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 = 0 or 4 = 0\)</span>. The
sub-expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 = 0\)</span> is clearly <strong>False</strong> and so is the other
sub-expression <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4 = 0\)</span>. This means the initial expression is <strong>False</strong>.
result is either <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>. Another possible evaluation is if
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_1_W4</span></code> is equal to zero (and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_2_W4</span></code> remains equal to 4). In
this case the resulting expression is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0 = 0 or 4 = 0\)</span>. In this case,
the first sub-expression is <strong>True</strong>, and although the second is <strong>False</strong>,
only one is needed for the overall expression to be <strong>True</strong>.</p>
<p>These conditions can have nested sub-expressions and get complex fairly quickly.
However, the underlying mechanism to evaluate them remains the same: replace
variables with values and decide the result (<strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>). OnTask
relies on these expressions to personalize the content of the actions. Let’s
now go back to the screen to edit an action. The area has four components</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The filter</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The top area contains a <em>filter</em>. This element is an expression used to
decide which learners (or more precisely, the corresponding rowsin the data
table that) will be selected and used in this action.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_action_out_filterpart.png"><img alt="../_images/action_action_out_filterpart.png" src="../_images/action_action_out_filterpart.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p class="last">In the example above, the expression selects 3 out of all 14 learners in
the data table. This filter is useful when you want to provide the
personalized text to a sub-set of the learners. For example, you may want
to send a reminder about the submission deadline the day before but only to
those students that haven’t connected to the system. If you have that
informatio in a column of the data table, you may create the condition
that selects only those learners.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The conditions</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This area contains additional expressions called <em>conditions</em>.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_action_out_conditionpart.png"><img alt="../_images/action_action_out_conditionpart.png" src="../_images/action_action_out_conditionpart.png" style="width: 100%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>A condition is another expression (identical to the filter) but it will be
used in the middle of the text to decide if a portion of the text will be
shown or ignored. The buttons in the screen allow you to edit the expression,
insert the condition to control the appearance of text in the editor
(below), clone the condition, or delete it from the action.</p>
<p class="last">For each condition, the button shows the number of learners for which the
expression in that condition evaluates to <strong>True</strong>. If this value is zero,
it means that any text you include in the editor surrounded by this
condition will not appear for any of the learners.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The HTML text editor</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is the area to create the personalized document. It is a conventional
HTML editor offering the usual functionalities (inserting text in
various forms, headings, lists, links, images, etc.) Right above the editor
window you have two choice menus that you can use to insert either a
<a class="reference internal" href="#details-attributes"><span class="std std-ref">workflow attribute</span></a> or a column name that will
be replaced by the corresponding value.</p>
<div class="last figure align-center">

</div>
</dd>
<dt>The Preview button</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The Preview button shows how the text in the editor is shown for those
learners selected by the filter (if any). After clicking in the button you
will see a window with the resulting text. If there are any elements in the
text that are controlled by any condition, the bottom area will show their
values.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

</div>
<p class="last">Use the arrow buttons to see all the different versions of the text
depending on the values stored in the table for each learner.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The Save button</dt>
<dd>This button saves the content of the text editor and returns to the page

</dl>
<div class="section" id="using-column-values-attributes-and-conditions-in-a-personalized-text">
<h4>Using column values, attributes and conditions in a Personalized Text<a class="headerlink" href="#using-column-values-attributes-and-conditions-in-a-personalized-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The text in these actions may include three types of elements that
are personalized for each learner: an attribute name, a column name or a
portion of text marked with a condition.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Attributes</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Attributes are simply synonyms that you may want to use in more than one
action. For example, if you have several actions that include the name of a
course, instead of including that name if all actions, you may define an
<em>attribute</em> with name <em>course name</em> and value <em>Biology 101</em> and include in
the actions the attribute name. OnTask will replace that attribute with its
value when showing the text to the learners. If you then change the name of
the course (or you export this workflow and import it to be used in
anotehr course), you only need to change the attribute and the name of the
course will appear correctly in all actions (in what is called a <em>single
point of change</em>).</p>
<p class="last">To insert an attribute name in the text simply place the cursor in the
editor where you want the value of that attribute to appear and select
the attribute from the area above the editor. The name of the attribute
will be inserted in the text surrounded by double curly braces, (for
example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">course_name</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. Only <a class="reference internal" href="#details-attributes"><span class="std std-ref">the attributes</span></a>
you previously created in the details page are available.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Column names</dt>
<dd>The other element that can be personalized is a column name. For example,
suppose you have a column in your table with the first name of the learners.
You can use the column name to personalize the greeting in the text.
To insert a column name, you follow the same steps used for the attribute but
this time you select the column name from the pull-down menu. You will see
that the name of the column appears in the text also surrounded by
double curly braces (for example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hi</span> <span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">GivenName</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></code>. The double curly
braces is the way OnTask has to mark that text to be personalized or
replaced by the corresponding value for each learner extracted from the data
table.</dd>
<dt>Conditional text</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Using a condition to control if a portion of the text is shown or
ignored is slightly different. First highlight the text you want to appear
depending on the condition in the
editor. Then go to the corresponding button for the condition, click in the
arrow next to its name, and select <em>Insert in text</em>. The text will be
surrounded by two marks. For example
if the condition name is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_active</span></code>, the text you highlighted will
appear in the editor afer clicking in the <em>Insert in text</em> as:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">{</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">Video_active</span> <span class="o">%</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="n">Good</span> <span class="n">work</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="n">week</span><span class="s1">&#39;s video{</span><span class="si">% e</span><span class="s1">ndif %}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This format marks the message <em>Good work with this week’s video</em> to
appear only for those learners for which the condition <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Video_active</span></code>
evaluates to <strong>True</strong> with their current values in the data table.
Otherwise, the text will be ignored. The following figure illustrates this process.</p>

<h4>Offering the survey to the learners<a class="headerlink" href="#offering-the-survey-to-the-learners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The second operation available for <em>survey</em> actions is to make available the
URL to learners so that theyindividually enter the information themselves. In
the action table each survey action has a button labeled <em>URL</em>. If you click
in this button the screen shows the URL for the survey and the possibility of
enable/disable it or even provide a date/time window for its availability.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/action_action_in_URL.png"><img alt="../_images/action_action_in_URL.png" src="../_images/action_action_in_URL.png" style="width: 80%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Once enabled, you may send the URL to the students (you may even use a
personalized text action for that). Once the students click in the action,
after authenticaiton, and if their email is part of hte table, they will be
able to enter the information and the values are automatically stored in the
right row and column in the table.</p>
<p>These survey actions are ideal to collect information about any aspect of a
course in a way that is centralized and available for further processing
through personalized text actions. For example, users may choose from a
pre-defined set of topics those that were more challenging. This information
can then be used in a personalized text action to provide the adequate
resources to each learner.</p>

<div>“I have no regular schedule. I get up whenever I can.”
– Jimmy Wales</div></blockquote>
<p>The <em>personalized text actions</em> sending emails can be
<em>scheduled</em> to execute at some point in the future. The <em>Schedule</em> operation
for these actions opens a dialog like the one shown in the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/schedule_action_email.png" src="../_images/schedule_action_email.png" />
</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>A name to identify this scheduling (a user may have several of these
actions pending in a workflow)</dd>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>A brief description explaining this scheduled action.</dd>
<dt>Column containing email</dt>
<dd>The column in the table used to fill out the destination email. OnTask will
check that the data in that column has the right format.</dd>
<dt>When to execute the action</dt>
<dd>A date/time in the future when the action will be executed.</dd>
<dt>Email subject</dt>
<dd>The text to be included in the email subjects.</dd>
<dt>Comma separated list of CC emails</dt>
<dd>A comma separated list of emails to include in the <em>carbon copy</em> (or CC)
field of the email.</dd>
<dt>Comma separated list of BCC emails</dt>
<dd>A comma separated list of emails to include in the <em>blind carbon copy</em> (or
BCC) field of the email.</dd>
<dt>Send confirmation email</dt>
<dd>Select this option if you want a confirmation email sent to you.</dd>
<dt>Track when emails are read</dt>
<dd>Include in the messages a HTML snipped to detect if the email is read.
OnTask adds an extra column to the table to store the number of times the
message is opened. This detection relies on how the email client opens the
message and processes the included images, therefore, the information in
this column may not accurately reflect this information.</dd>
<dt>Check/exclude emails</dt>
<dd>If selected, this option inserts an extra step in which you can eliminate
certain emails form the action. This feature is useful to remove certain
emails that cannot be removed with the filter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <em>Schedule</em> in the top menu shows the page with the scheduled tasks for
the current workflow. The left-most column offers the operations to edit or
delete the scheduled execution.</p>

<p>The platform keeps a log of most of the operations that are executed when

<p>The additional method offered by OnTask to manipulate the data in a workflow’s table is to execute arbitrary Python code encapsulated as a Python module and placed in a predefined folder in the computer hosting the server. In the context of the platform, these Python modules are called <strong>Plugins</strong> and require some <a class="reference internal" href="../Install/index.html#plugin-install"><span class="std std-ref">previous configuration</span></a>. Before their execution, a plugin must be written and installed in the folder previously considered for that purpose.</p>
<p>The purpose of the plugins is to allow arbitrary transformations of the data attached to a workflow. The list of plugins available for execution can be accessed through the link <em>Transform</em> in the <em>Dataops</em> top menu item.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_transform_list.png" src="../_images/dataops_transform_list.png" />
</div>
<p>Each plugin is shown with a (unique) name, a description, the last time the code was modified (based on the file modification time), if the plugin is ready to execute, and the link for either the <em>Run</em> operation, or a link to the diagnostics if the execution is not possible.</p>
<p>The plugin execution request shows a form to collect the parameters required for the operation.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="../_images/dataops_transformation_run.png" src="../_images/dataops_transformation_run.png" />
</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Input columns</dt>
<dd>The columns from the data table that will be passed to the plugin. The plugin can define a set of <em>fixed</em> column names to extract. If this list is empty, the list is requested from the user.</dd>
<dt>Key column for merging</dt>
<dd>The plugins are supposed to create additional columns, and they need to be merged with the existing data. For this procedure, a key-column is needed to make sure the rows of the newly created data are correctly stored. They key column from the current data frame is added as part of the input data frame passed to the plugin.</dd>
<dt>Output column names</dt>
<dd>The plugins defines the names of the result columns. However, the upon execution, the user may rename any of those columns.</dd>
<dt>Suffix to add to the result columns</dt>
<dd>This field is provided to do a one-place renaming. If given, this suffix is added to the names of all output columns.</dd>
<dt>Execution parameters</dt>
<dd>This part of the form requests the pairs <em>(name, value)</em> as defined by the plugin.</dd>
</dl>
<p>After the appropriate data is provided the tool shows a plugin executing report showing the columns that will be created and how will they be merged with the existing data.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h3>Plugin requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#plugin-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Python modules installed in the predefined folder need to satisfy various requirements to be considered for execution within OnTask. More precisely, the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__init__.py</span></code> must contain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Module variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">class_name</span></code> with the name of the class in the file that contains the required definitions.</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">name</span></code> with the plugin name to show to the users.</li>
<li>Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">escription_txt</span></code> with a string with the detailed description of what the
plugin does</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">input_column_names</span></code> with a potentially empty list of column names
(strings). If the list is empty, the columns are selected by the user at
execution time.</p>
<p>4. Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">output_column_names</span></code> with a non empty list of names (strings) of the
columns to be used for the output of the transformation.</p>
<p>5. Class field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">parameters</span></code> with an optionally empty list with tuples with the following
structure:</p>

<p>These elements will be requested from the user before executing the
plugin through a form. The conditions on these values are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>name must be a string</li>
<li>type must be a string equal to “integer”, “double”, “string”,
“datetime” or “boolean”.</li>
<li>The list of values is to restrict the
possible values</li>
<li>The initial value must be of the type specified by the second
element.</li>
<li>Help_text a string to show as help text</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="6">
<li><p class="first">Class method <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run</span></code> that receives:</p>
<ul class="simple">

the result.</li>
<li>A dictionary of pairs (name, value) with the parameters described in

<p>an d returns a result Pandas data frame. This frame <strong>must</strong> have one
