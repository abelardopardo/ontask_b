    "But anyone who has experienced flow knows that the deep enjoyment it provides requires an equal degree of disciplined concentration."

After logging into OnTask, the platform shows the buttons to create or import a workflow as well as those already available to the user as shown in the following figure.

   The **Workflows** link at the left corner of the top menu *closes* the workflow being manipulated and shows you the list of available workflows. The workflow is also *unlocked* so that it can be accessed by those users :ref:`sharing <details_sharing>` its access.

The navigation through the platform is done using the links in the top menu bar. The *Workflows* icon in the left side of the menu brings the user back to the page showing the available workflows. The book icon in the upper right side of the menu bar opens the documentation page, and the user icon provides access to the user profile (name, last name, bio, password and authentication tokens).

The home page offers the following operations:

.. _workflow_create:

*New workflow*
  Opens a dialog to set the name and description of a new workflow and then show the page to upload data in the table.

  Changes the name of the description given to the workflow.

|fa-clone| *Create a duplicate*
  Creates a duplicate or exact copy of the workflow with the prefix *Copy_of_* added to the  workflow name.

|fa-minus-square| *Delete all data*
  Deletes all data and actions stored in the workflow (turns it into an empty workflow with just the name and the description).

|fa-trash| *Delete the workflow*
  Delete the workflow from the system.

|fa-star-o| *Mark as favourite*
  Mark the workflow as favourite to be shown at the top of the screen.

When a workflow is open, the top-bar menu appears with the structure shown in the following figure.

Once you open a workflow, the platform *locks it* so that no other user can manipulate it (see :ref:`sharing a workflow <details_sharing>`). The lock is released navigating back to the home page, logging out, or the session expires after lack of activity. If you access a workflow and another user is currently using it, the platform will tell you that is locked and show who is holding the lock.
