This section contains a set of examples or *scenarios* showing how OnTask can
 be used. If you prefer to read about use cases instead of the manual, this is your place.

Do I really need this tool?
===========================

The first question you have to answer is if it really makes sense to use this
tool in your context or is this yet another useless software application.
To identify if OnTask is useful answer the following questions:

1. Is there a moment during the deployment of a learning experience in which it makes sense to either gather or provide students with personalised information about their experience?

2. Do I have access to the data to personalise such communication with the students? For example, if you want to contact certain students regarding the use of certain resource, do you have the data telling you who used such resource?

3. Do I know what I would like to do once I got both the moment and the data identified? For example, I would like to write certain students a message, or provide them some specific resources, or give them some suggestions.

OnTask will likely be useful to you if you answer **yes** to all three
questions. It is very important that you start your process from the learning
design, that is, from where in the experience you think makes sense to
provide some personalised resource to the students. In the remaining of this
section we have included a set of scenarios that range from very simple to
very complex. Each of them has two files available for you to download:

1. The CSV file with the data used in the example.

2. The complete workflow (data and actions).

Create a new workflow and use the first file to upload the data and try to replicate the steps described in each scenario, or use the second file to import the complete workflow and browse through its elements.
