"<strong><super>*</super></strong>A workflow contains a <i>table\n"
"    </i> with data about a set of learners and <i>a\n"
"      collection of actions</i>. The table is organised by <i>columns</i> "
"and the information in each row corresponds\n"
"      to one learner. The actions will behave differently depending on the "
"values stored for every learner and a set\n"
"      of conditions. These conditions can be written based on the values of "
"the columns for each student. Typically,\n"
"      you create a workflow for a cohort of learners for which you have data "
"available. Then you write the actions\n"
"      depending on a) when you want students to introduce data or b) when "
"you want students to receive personalised\n"
"      data. The personalisation is done writing conditions to enable/disable "
"text or other elements in a page. The\n"
"      page can either be sent to the learner through email, shown through a "
"HTML address, or sent to another\n"
"      machine."
